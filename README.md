# Overview

This library is designed to rank randomizer racers. It's based on the Glicko-2
rating system with some experimental modifications. You can read about Mark
Glickman's Glicko-2 system [here](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf).
The multiplayer implementation was partially borrowed from [ms2300's implementation](https://github.com/ms2300/multiplayer-glicko2).

# Usage

You can install RandoRank as a python package with pip by running
`pip install randorank`. The first thing you'll want to do is determine a
period length(e.g. four weeks.) To use this library to rank randomizer players,
you can simply instantiate a `MultiPeriod` class, set the system variables with
the `add_constants()` method, add races with the `add_race()` method, then
export a dictionary of players with their ranking with the `rank()` method.
When a period has concluded, you can feed this dict into a new MultiPeriod
instance with the `add_players()` method.

## Setting Constants and Multiplayer Glicko Implementation

The MultiPeriod class will initialize with a default set of constants
designed for the A Link to the Past Randomizer. To set your own constants,
create a dict with the following keys:

```python
example_constants = {'tau': .02,
                     'multi_slope': .008,
                     'multi_cutoff': 8,
                     'norm_factor': 1.3
                     'initial_rating': 1500,
                     'initial_deviation': 50,
                     'initial_volatility': .01}
```
**tau** is the Glicko system constant. For randomizer races, it should be set
low, around .02. **multi\_slope**, **multi\_cutoff**, and **norm\_factor** are
part of the multiplayer implementation, which divides races into a series of
1v1 matches and applies a weight based on race size and how close two racers
finished compared to each other and the distribution of times in the race.

The cutoff determines how many runners a race must have for the library
to use the multiplayer implementation. Below that, it will use the stock
Glicko formula. The normalization factor is used to determine a "floor" time
for the race and is game-specific. The formula for scoring a normalized race
is first\_quartile + (IQR * norm\_factor). Times in between are assigned a
value between 0 and 1, 1 being the first place finisher. Since this formula is less
accurate with less racers, we use the cutoff to prevent it from skewing final
rankings. The slope is used later as part of the formula for determining a
1v1's weight.

In races above the cutoff, we take the original weight and multiply it by
the result of the following: 
`1 - (multi_slope * (size ** (1 - abs(normed_score_diff)))) * (1 / (1 - multi_slope))`
This generally means that the bigger the race, and the closer the two runners'
finish times, the lower the weight for their 1v1. But no matter the race size,
top finishers' scores against the very bottom will remain the same.

## Adding Races

Races are passed to the `add_race()` method as a dictionary with names as keys
and times (in seconds) as values. If a runner does not finish a race, their
value should be NaN. You can use `nan` values in python by importing the type
from the math module(`from math import nan`). Suppose you want to add a race
with three runners, one of whom forfeited. You would pass this dictionary:

```python
example_race = {'runner 1': 1563,
                'runner 2': 1620,
                'runner 3': nan}
```
It's important that you convert all non-finishers to NaN and don't use a number
like 0. NaN is a special numerical type indicating that the value is "not a
number."

## End of Period Rankings

Using the `rank()` method of the MultiPeriod instance will export a dictionary
of dictionaries containing each runner's rating, deviation, volatility, inactive periods,
variance, and delta for the end of the period. The latter three values can be
discarded if you're done ranking players. If you want to continue ranking over
multiple periods, you can pass this to the `add_players()` method of a new
MultiPeriod instance.

# Practical Considerations

If you want to continuously calculate rankings throughout a period, it's
important that you always use players' pre-period variables and do not pass
a ranking dict back to the same instance. You can, however, continue to add
races and call `rank()` again.

If you want to serialize results mid-period and get rankings for players
who have played in new races for that period, you can pass `False` to the
`rank()` method, instantiate a new MultiPeriod, use `add_players()` to add
only runners who have participated in the new races, add the races, then
`rank()` to get the new values for those players.
